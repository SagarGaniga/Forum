# VESITforum
MINI-Project
By Team Sparks

## An online platform where Vesitians can create their own profile and can interact with other users and help each in this journey of 4 years. VESITforum provides users (Vesitians) to communicate with each other much better than creating groups on any chatting platform. VESITforum provides the users with an experience just like a social platform which seems to be friendly for everyone these days.

### The major goals of the VESITforum are to:
* Solve as many queries as possible about VESIT
* Provide an Web Interface to display queries
* Provide a platform to answer the queries posted by users
* Work as a catalyst to mobilize knowledge, resources and organizational action to advance the VES agenda
* Work to ensure that all the students have a platform where they can post their queries
* Mobilize public awareness on queries related to VESIT, and promote sharing and dissemination.
